# Simple implementation of a Topological sort in C++11

This is just a simple test project.
For a sophisticated solution to the topological sort problem, please look at the
Boost library.

Vertices are the keys of an associative container. The value of that container
is a list of vertices to which there exists a connection.

## Examples

## TODO
Add Travis configuration file
Add address sanitizer checks
Add cppcheck
Add Valgrind
